"""
Given an array of integers (both positive and negative numbers), and a sum value as input, find the total subarrays that added up
would result in the given input sum.

For example,
input array - [1,2,3,0] and sum = 3
possible sub arrays with sum = 3 are: [1,2], [3], [3,0]
so, output should be 3.
